## Our Dashboard visualization

### App description

The app contains three charts that answer 3 different research questions on jobs and unemployment across industries. The three tabs allow users to choose which aspect of jobs and unemployment across industries (Job Growth Across Industries, Unemployment Over Years, Seasonal Unemployment) to visualize. In the first tab about the job growth across industries, users can select to show the job growth in a specific year or multiple years via a slider. In the tab regarding unemployment over the years, uses can filter for a specific industry or multiple industies. In the third tab of seasonal unemployment, both the slider and the dropdown checklist will allow users to filter the industries and specify the year at the same time. In all three tabs a radio button will allow users to choose how they would like to visualize the data (i.e. show the rates or counts). A tooltip will be available when hovering over specific data points to display the exact values (rate/count, year, industry) of points.
