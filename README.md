## Our Dashboard visualization

### App description

The app contains three charts (depending on the research questions, lollipop chart, line chart, etc.) that show the trends in industries unemployment. The three taps allow users to choose which trend (Job Growth Across Industries, Unemployment Over Years, Seasonal Unemployment) to visualize. From a slider in the first tab about the job growth across industries, users can select to show the job growth in a specific year. From a dropdown checklist in the tab regarding unemployment over the years, uses can filter out industries from the chart and show the industries they care about. In the third tab of seasonal unemployment, both the slider and the dropdown checklist will allow users to filter the industries and specify the year at the same time. Meanwhile, a radio button will allow users to choose the value of the chart (i.e. show the rates or amount) in all three tabs.
